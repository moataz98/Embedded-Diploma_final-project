# Embedded-Diploma_final-project
Two ATmega16 microcontrollers and an I²C-controller EEPROM were used in this project. One of the microcontroller units was used as the HMI unit while the other acted as the 
control unit. Drivers implemented during this project were UART, I²C, keypad, LCD, timer, and PWM drivers. The project was simulated using proteus and was developed bare metal
using the C programming language.
